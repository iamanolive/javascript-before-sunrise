# bits and bytes

* information in a computer is represented using electricity
* 1 = signal is on and 0 = signal is off. on/off state of a single wire is a bit (smallest piece of information a computer is capable of storing)
* bit = *bi*nary digi*t*
* bits are stored using electromechanical transistors that map electrical signals to either an on or off state.

## the binary number system

* made up only of two digits instead of 10 like in the decimal system
* the value of the position is multiplied by 2 as we move to the left (starting from 2 raised to 0 at the rightmost place)
* number of values a sequence of bits can represent is be calculated by raising 2 to the power of the count of bits in the sequence.

## text in binary

* numbers assigned to each letter of the alphabet

## images in binary

* images are made up of pixels (tiny dots), each of which has a color that can be represented with numbers.

## sound in binary

* sound is a series of vibrations in the air, which can be represented graphically as a waveform. and any point on this waveform can be represented as a number.
* sound can be broken down into a series of numbers

## binary conversions

* byte = unit of digital information that consists of 8 bits
* convert from bits to bytes by dividing by 8
* convert from bytes to bits by multiplying by 8

## bytes in computer science

* computers prefer to process bits in byte-sized groupings
* smallest addressable unit of memory (a singular piece of data that is smaller than a byte cannot be stored)

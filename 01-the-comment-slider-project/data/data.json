Firstly I must thank you for all the pictures, names and details 😍 so, so, so cute!\n\nI’m so glad you have a cat of your own because you care soo much. This post just reminded me how much pets mean to us– getting to know their personalities and their little quirks, how they react to you, to watch them learn new things and the company they give. You are never lonely with a pet and they can always make you smile.\n\np.s. I absolutely adored your writing, wonderfully fabulous 😍😍",

He’ll be 2yrs next month and oh boy 😅 he BIG. But long too so atleast it doesn’t look all fat. (He’s bigger than the dachshunds!!)\n\nFew tips for you:\n1- milk actually isn’t good for cats.. you shall give them water instead 🙂\n2- yess kittens are nice but please consider spay/neuter. Not only will it make it less likely for Winnie to « spray » around the house, but also not make it run away to mate! (They can be creative.. I heard a cat running away by the washing machine pipe!!)\n\nOfcourse lots of love for you two! Xx",

AND THE PICTURES!! 🤩\n\nAnd lololol, the parts about cats drinking the muckiest, most disgusting liquid out there when you’ve also offered them a bowl of clean water is so true! We actually have to keep careful watch on our bathrooms because one of our cats thinks toilet water is the best thing ever 🙈",

I think my house would become a menagerie 😂\n\nAll of your pictures are so adorable. I love the markings on each of the cats. I also always love it when they cross their legs like that.\n\nI’m sorry to hear about the poor kitten that died. It might have had something wrong with it maybe which could also be why it’s mother abandoned it. Although like you’d I’d definitely have taken it in.\n\nI hope you get lots of cuddles with Winnie. Maybe one day some of the others will return too.",
